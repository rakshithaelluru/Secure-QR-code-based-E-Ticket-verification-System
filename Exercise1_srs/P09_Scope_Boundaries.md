# Scope Boundaries Document

The scope boundary defines what is included and what is excluded in the system.

The Secure QR Code–Based E-Ticket Verification System starts with the generation of a digital ticket and a unique QR code for the user. It includes storing ticket details in a centralized database and verifying the QR code at the entry point using a scanner or mobile device.

The system ends when the QR code is successfully validated and the ticket is marked as used in the database. Any further processes such as payment, refund, or customer support are outside the scope boundary of this system.

Thus, the boundary of the system is limited to ticket generation, QR code creation, scanning, and verification.
