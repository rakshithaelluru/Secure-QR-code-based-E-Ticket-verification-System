# Problem Statement
In many places such as public transport systems, movie theatres, and event venues, ticket verification is still done manually or using simple checking methods. This process is slow, requires more manpower, and is prone to human errors. It is also difficult to detect fake, duplicate, or reused tickets, which leads to security risks, overcrowding, and financial loss.
# Proposed Solution
The proposed system introduces a QR code–based e-ticket verification system supported by a centralized database. Each ticket will be generated with a unique QR code. At the entry point, the QR code will be scanned and verified in real time using the database. Once validated, the ticket will be marked as used, preventing reuse and fraud.
# Target Users

-Event organizers

-Transport authorities

-Theatre and parking management

-Ticket verifiers

-Customers who use e-tickets
# Value Proposition
The system provides fast and secure ticket verification, reduces manual effort, prevents ticket fraud, and improves user experience. It ensures one-time ticket usage, increases operational efficiency, and enhances overall security and reliability of the ticketing process.
